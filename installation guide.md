# haskell
## installation
The easiest way to write your haskell code is through VSC and its extensions. Then install [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) (which  makes it easy to install specific versions of GHC on GNU/Linux, macOS (aka Darwin), FreeBSD and Windows and can also bootstrap a fresh Haskell developer environment from scratch. It follows the UNIX philosophy of do one thing and do it well).

1. Download VSC.
2. Open VSC
3. To install `haskell` in VSC. Go to extension in menu bar then type `haskell`, select the one. Shown as following figure.

4. install GHCup.
   
After a soon of installing the `haskell` extension, VSC will popup an alert, prompting one to install `GHCup`. 

If it does NOT popup, you can install GHCup from my notes [GHCup installing(my Notes at Github)](https://github.com/40843245/GHCup/blob/main/quickstart%20guide.md#installation).

For more details about GHCup, see [GHCup](https://github.com/40843245/GHCup).
