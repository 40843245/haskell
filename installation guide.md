# haskell
## installation
The easiest way to write your haskell code is through VSC and its extensions. Then install [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) (which  makes it easy to install specific versions of GHC on GNU/Linux, macOS (aka Darwin), FreeBSD and Windows and can also bootstrap a fresh Haskell developer environment from scratch. It follows the UNIX philosophy of do one thing and do it well).

For more details about GHCup, see [GHCup](https://github.com/40843245/GHCup).
