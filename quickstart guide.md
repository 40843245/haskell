# haskell
## Intro
Haskell is a general-purpose, statically-typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.[26][27] Designed for teaching, research, and industrial applications.

For more details, see [Haskell (Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell).

## installation
See [installation guide (my Notes at Github)](https://github.com/40843245/haskell/blob/main/installation%20guide.md).

## Write a Haskell code
1. Open text editor or Haskell IDE.
2.
+ For text editor,
  1. write haskell code. A simple example haskell code:
  ```
  main :: IO ()
  main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
  ```
  2. save it as `.hs` file (such as `ex1.hs`).
  3. To execute the haskell code, open terminal and type command `runhaskell {YOURFILENAME}.hs` (here, it is `runhaskell hello.hs`) and press `Enter` to execute the command.
